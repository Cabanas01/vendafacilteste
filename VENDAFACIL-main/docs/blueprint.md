## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) - A medium blue (#3399CC) that is both trustworthy and energetic.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - A very light blue (#F0F8FF) provides a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 50%) - A bright cyan (#33CCCC) is used for interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. The slightly techy feel works for the reports and settings application, but should be paired with 'Inter' for readability in larger blocks of text.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Used for the bulk of on-screen display because it is a classic body font with an objective and readable look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Simple, clear icons for navigation and actions, following a consistent style.
- Clean and organized layout with clear sections for different types of settings.
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback.
